# GLM_tutorials
various tutorials for workshops on GLMs in ecology with R

Each is a slight variation of the others. I co-led the [GLAMM workshop](https://anamtk.github.io/GLM_tutorials/GLAMM_summer2020/GLM_Tutorial.html) with [Tatum Katz](https://tatumskatz.weebly.com/), who contributed the amazing GLM math explanations.

I've taken the practical piece of this initial workshop and developed it for two additional tutorials, [one which I distributed to several collaborators](https://anamtk.github.io/GLM_tutorials/GLM_fall2020/GLM_inR_Tutorial.html) and one which I used to lead a [Tidy Tuesday workshop](https://anamtk.github.io/GLM_tutorials/tidyTuesday_fall2020/GLM_inR_Tutorial.html). The goal of both of these is to be able to apply a GLM process in R from data to paper for any kind of linear model.

I've learned a lot from [Kyle Edwards' lecture notes](https://sites.google.com/site/kyleedwardsresearch/lecture-notes?authuser=0)
